# NYT COVID-19 Data Fetcher
Spawned by the inability of Siri to serve relevant, parameterized data for COVID-19, I created an iOS Short Cut that invokes this API to provide me what Apple doesn't: given a location, provide me with a snapshot of COVID-19 within that region via total case counts and percent changes within the last week.
